## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Renting a property can be a stressful experience where you would want communication with your landlord or tenant to be straight forward, transparent and concise.

Communication between tenants and landlords currently uses a variety of different communication methods and its difficult to work out which one is best for a given situation, this makes something simple like getting your sink repaired unnecessarily time consuming and difficult.

The long term impact of this may result in landlords and tenants getting frustrated with one another and making an already stressful experience even more unpleasant.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

Our solution to this was to build a platform that connected landlords and tenants directly, to enable both parties to build a positive and long standing relationship through clear communication and trust with an emphasis on security all whilst being wrapped in an intuitive clean morden UI.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- What are the dependencies of your project?
- Describe each limitation in detailed but concise terms
- Explain why each limitation exists
- Provide the reasons why each limitation could not be overcome using the method(s) chosen to acquire.
- Assess the impact of each limitation in relation to the overall findings and conclusions of your project, and if
  appropriate, describe how these limitations could point to the need for further research.

-Not a mandatory way of communication both parties need to be onboard.
-We will be holding users key documentation and user data so GDPR compliance must be adhered to.
-Authorisation and security is paramount.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

We didn't have time to implement secure document storage, as a result we scaled back our mvp to focus on the job board, ticket generation with a custom chat interface for said tickets, whilst having our user roles set we are in the process of finalising our database so that specific landlords can connect with specific tenants via linked IDs .

In the future we are confident that we can implement the above document storage as well as a host of other features ie: payment monitor, a tools and guides page to help tenants maintain the property themselves, the option to download transcripts and templates for things like inventories, checkout and tenancy agreements.

## üèÅ Visit Our Website <a name = "vist_our_website"></a>

You can sign up to our app by visiting <a href="www.letchat.co.uk">LetChat</a>

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

When you first visit the site you can sign up with an email address this must be valid as you will receive a conformation email.
For security reasons we designed the app to be protected until verification is complete.
Once verified you will be able to login with email and password.
You will them be redirected to our job board where you interact with the app.
Once again for security reasons, if your forget to logout your account will be logged out on page close.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Lessons Learned <a name = "lessons_learned"></a>

- We learned Next.js and how much more we like it than vanilla React. Used Next's built-in router as well as the Context API.
- TailwindCSS and daisyUI for fast prototyping and further visual styling.
- Using Firebase for auth and role-based user permissions. Adding security with email link validation.
- Using mock data until as late as possible so the data-model has time to develop and therefore there's less time needs to be spent coding the backend.
- Good planning in general goes a long way and then the code basically writes itself.
- After a couple of weeks we realised our team structure in the way we were working together and that splitting into pairs made us much more productive.
- Colour blindness and other general accessibility concerns.
- The importance of market research.
- More on Postgres data types.
- Understating about the architecture of a full-stack app starting with a the visual aspect.
- We learned to compromise on UI for the sake of UX for a better user workflow.
- Different approaches in designing a component tree.
- If in doubt - 'npm i'
- Restart your server after adding .env
- Deploying a custom domain on Netlify.
- Unit testing with Next.
- How to use images in Next.
- Cross-page rendering.
- How to work with unfamiliar coding practices.
- Dynamic routing in Next.
- Different pairs work better together in different situations.
- Awaiting promises properly in TypeScript and lots more TS in general.
- How to pass Regex patterns in Next.
