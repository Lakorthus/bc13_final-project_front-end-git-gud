## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Renting a property can be a stressful experience where you would want communication with your landlord or tenant to be straight forward, transparent and concise.

Communication between tenants and landlords currently uses a variety of different communication methods and its difficult to work out which one is best for a given situation, this makes something simple like getting your sink repaired unnecessarily time consuming and difficult.

The long term impact of this may result in landlords and tenants getting frustrated with one another and making an already stressful experience even more unpleasant.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

Our solution to this was to build a platform that connected landlords and tenants directly, to enable both parties to build a positive and long standing relationship through clear communication and trust with an emphasis on security all whilst being wrapped in an intuitive clean morden UI.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- What are the dependencies of your project?
- Describe each limitation in detailed but concise terms
- Explain why each limitation exists
- Provide the reasons why each limitation could not be overcome using the method(s) chosen to acquire.
- Assess the impact of each limitation in relation to the overall findings and conclusions of your project, and if
  appropriate, describe how these limitations could point to the need for further research.

-Not a mandatory way of communication both parties need to be onboard.
-We will be holding users key documentation and user data so GDPR compliance must be adhered to.
-Authorisation and security is paramount.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

We didn't have time to implement secure document storage, as a result we scaled back our mvp to focus on the job board, ticket generation with a custom chat interface for said tickets, whilst having our user roles set we are in the process of finalising our database so that specific landlords can connect with specific tenants via linked IDs .

In the future we are confident that we can implement the above document storage as well as a host of other features ie: payment monitor, a tools and guides page to help tenants maintain the property themselves, the option to download transcripts and templates for things like inventories, checkout and tenancy agreements.
