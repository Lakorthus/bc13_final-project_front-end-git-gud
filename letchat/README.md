# LetChat

The app was designed to facilitate better communication between landlords and tenants. Our research showed that people generally weren't happy with the communication options they had and would prefer an all-in-one solution of chatting and document storage.

## Lessons Learned

- We learned Next.js and how much more we like it than vanilla React. Used Next's built-in router as well as the Context API.
- TailwindCSS and daisyUI for fast prototyping and further visual styling.
- Using Firebase for auth and role-based user permissions. Adding security with email link validation.
- Using mock data until as late as possible so the data-model has time to develop and therefore there's less time needs to be spent coding the backend.
- Good planning in general goes a long way and then the code basically writes itself.
- After a couple of weeks we realised our team structure in the way we were working together and that splitting into pairs made us much more productive.
- Colour blindness and other general accessibility concerns.
- The importance of market research.
- More on Postgres data types.
- Understating about the architecture of a full-stack app starting with a the visual aspect.
- We learned to compromise on UI for the sake of UX for a better user workflow.
- Different approaches in designing a component tree.
- If in doubt - 'npm i'
- Restart your server after adding .env
- Deploying a custom domain on Netlify.
- Unit testing with Next.
- How to use images in Next.
- Cross-page rendering.
- How to work with unfamiliar coding practices.
- Dynamic routing in Next.
- Different pairs work better together in different situations.
- Awaiting promises properly in TypeScript and lots more TS in general.
- How to pass Regex patterns in Next.

## Roadmap

- Hook up tenants with the right landlords

- Document storage (such as tenancy agreements and invoices)

- Information page - guidance for tenants and landlords, such as CAB links

- Inventory template
